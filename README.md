## Features

- Real-time particle simulation with thousands of interactive elements
- Multiple collaboration modes showcasing different human-AI interaction patterns
- Touch-enabled for mobile devices
- Dynamic color palettes that evolve with user interaction
- Efficient spatial partitioning for smooth performance
- Customizable parameters for easy experimentation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-ai-creative-playground.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd human-ai-creative-playground
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

For online hosting, simply enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, pointing to the main branch or `/docs` folder.

## Usage

1. Select a collaboration mode from the dropdown menu.
2. Interact with the particle system using your mouse or touch input.
3. Observe how the AI responds to your actions in different modes.
4. Experiment with different interaction patterns to create unique visual effects.

## Collaboration Modes

### 1. Turn-Based Creation
Human and AI take turns influencing the particle system. Every two seconds, human input creates strong directional forces, while the AI maintains organic motion between interactions.

### 2. AI-enhanced Drawing
Your mouse or touch strokes are enhanced with procedural patterns generated by the AI, creating complex textures from simple inputs.

### 3. Swarm Guidance
Direct particle flocks with your input while the AI maintains cohesion and alignment within the swarm.

### 4. Color Harmony
Particles dynamically change colors based on proximity to each other and user interaction, creating evolving color patterns.

## Technical Details

- Built with p5.js for easy canvas manipulation and animation
- Utilizes WEBGL rendering for improved performance
- Implements spatial partitioning (grid-based) for efficient neighbor calculations
- Uses offscreen buffers for trail effects and complex pattern generation

## Customization

Modify the `OPTIONS` object in `sketch.js` to adjust core parameters:

```javascript
const OPTIONS = {
  particleCount: 2000,
  zoneSize: 100,
  maxSpeed: 6,
  trailLength: 20,
  interactionRadius: 150
};
```

Experiment with these values to change the behavior and appearance of the particle system.

## Performance Optimization

- Spatial partitioning reduces neighbor checks from O(nÂ²) to O(n)
- Batch processing for particle updates
- Use of offscreen buffers for complex rendering tasks
- WEBGL mode for hardware-accelerated graphics
